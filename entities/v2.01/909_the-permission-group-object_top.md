**A Permission Group** sets a specific level of permissions. Each SSO is assigned to a permission group that defines which API elements the user is allowed to view, edit and create.
There are 3 default permission groups: 

**1. The "Admin" permission group** ( "Id": "ADMIN" ) that allows to: 
* View and edit client settings
* View data such as users details
* Edit data such as create a payin

**2. The "Read & Write" permission group** ( "Id": "WRITE" ) that allows to:
* View data such as users details
* Edit data such as create a payin

**3. The "Read Only" permission group** ( "Id": "READ" ) that allows to:
